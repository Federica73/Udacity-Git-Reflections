When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When other people are working on the repository or when I work from multiple location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   I may decide to update the local repository only after a set of changes on the remote repository are completed,
   or to wait until another contributor has reviewed/improved/completed/approved the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are useful when IÂ´d like to contribute to the repository, suggesting some changes. The owner of the repository can decide if implement them or not.
    Branches are useful for collaborating, when people work on the same repository with the same objectives and timelines.
    Clones are useful if I use the repository as a basis for creating my own repository, without the primary aim to contribute to the clones repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I am not so sure about this point. Probably to better tracking the changes when I have been disconnected for a while.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
